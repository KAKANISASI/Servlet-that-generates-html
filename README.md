# Servlet-that-generates-html
Create a Servlet subclassing "strictly" generic Servlet (as opposed to HttpServlet). 
Pass a value from the servlet to a newer HTML page.  
Display the message from the servlet on the HTML page. If there is no message, display null (nothing). 
There could be other simpler ways to do the same. I would like to know about them, if any! 
I hope the above code really helps someone out there, I spent A LOT and A LOT of time to figure this out, there was not any helpful internet resource to figure out the above! 
Thanks...
